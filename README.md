[FluentValidation](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation): A validation library for .NET that uses a fluent interface and lambda expressions for building strongly-typed validation rules.

[FluentAssertions](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions): A very extensive set of extension methods that allow you to more naturally specify the expected outcome of a TDD or BDD-style unit tests.

[protobuf-net](https://github.com/protobuf-net/protobuf-net): protobuf-net is a contract based serializer for .NET code, that happens to write data in the "protocol buffers" serialization format engineered by Google.

[hotchocolate](https://github.com/ChilliCream/hotchocolate): A GraphQL server to create GraphQL endpoints and merge schemas.

[FluentResults](https://github.com/altmann/FluentResults): FluentResults is a lightweight .NET library developed to solve a common problem. It returns an object indicating success or failure of an operation instead of throwing/using exceptions.

[Specification](https://github.com/ardalis/Specification): Base class with tests for adding specifications to a DDD model. Also includes a default generic Repository base class with support for EF6 and EF Core.

[Scrutor](https://github.com/khellang/Scrutor): Assembly scanning and decoration extensions for Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.

[RestSharp](https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp): RestSharp is a lightweight HTTP client library. It's a wrapper around HttpClient, not a full-fledged client on its own.
